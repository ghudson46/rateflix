  This app allows the user to search for a movie by entering the title, or a key word (ex: basketball, cats, glory etc.). The search results give you a list of movies that match the title or word. When the movie poster is clicked, a more detailed view of the movie is brought up. The user will see the title, year, director, plot, cast, rotten tomatos rating, runtime, and any awards it may have won or been nominated for.

  ## Installation
  the user does not need to install the app. The application is run in the browser by visiting the site's url.

  ## Usage
  the user goes to www.garretthudson.com/rateflix and enters their search criteria into the input bar. The search can be initiated by clicking the search button or hitting enter on the keyboard. To see more information on a specific movie, select the movie details button
